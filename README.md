One game at a time to help kids build up their programming foundation

[The basic steps of a function design recipe](https://htdp.org/2020-5-6/Book/part_preface.html)

1. From Problem Analysis to Data Definitions 

  Identify the information that must be represented and how it is represented in
  the chosen programming language. Formulate data definitions and illustrate
  them with examples.

2. Signature, Purpose Statement, Header

  State what kind of data the desired function consumes and produces. Formulate
  a concise answer to the question what the function computes. Define a stub
  that lives up to the signature.

3. Functional Examples

  Work through examples that illustrate the function’s purpose.

4. Function Template

  Translate the data definitions into an outline of the function.

5. Function Definition

  Fill in the gaps in the function template. Exploit the purpose statement and the examples.

6. Testing

  Articulate the examples as tests and ensure that the function passes all.
  Doing so discovers mistakes. Tests also supplement examples in that they help
  others read and understand the definition when the need arises—and it will
  arise for any serious program.
